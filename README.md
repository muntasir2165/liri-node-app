# liri-node-app

LIRI (Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface) is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data about your tweets, queried songs from Spotify and movies from OMDB.

## Project Motivation

This app was developed as part of the first Node.js homework assignment at the University of Toronto Full Stack Web Development bootcamp. This project involves using multiple Node.js packages that involve making HTTP requests, third party API calls (Twitter, Spotify, OMDB), reading files from the local file system and logging.

## Getting Started

1) Either download the zipped project from GitHub or clone the repo into your local machine.
2) Cd into the directory liri-node-app
3) run: npm install
4) run: node liri.js `<command> <parameter>`  
	where valid commands and parameters are:  
	    my-tweets  
	    spotify-this-song `<song name here>`  
	    movie-this `<movie name here>`  
	    do-what-it-says
